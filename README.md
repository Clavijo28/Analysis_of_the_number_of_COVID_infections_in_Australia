COVID 19 DATA VISUALIZATION

Introduction

The following analysis presents an in-depth study of the number of COVID 19 cases
in Australia stratified by state. As will be seen below, it is evident that some states have
critical levels and others do not, a clear example is the situation in Victoria with respect to
the increase in infections or the case of the northern area where cases are trending. steel. We
will also observe how the vaccination is in each of the states and we will observe a forecast by
state which will clarify the exact date in which Australia will reach 80% 90% and 100%, we
will also make some graphs of the relationship between new cases and vaccination to evaluate
how steep is the curve.

Conclusions

The forecasting methods described above are an approximation to reality with a lot
of uncertainty. Through the analysis of the coefficient of the quadratic mean it is possible
to validate this type of hypothesis, that is why it is necessary to draw much more assertive
forecasts so that precise decisions can be made.

The vaccination plans carried out by each of the state governments have helped a lot,
however it is clear that the measures adopted to contain the infection have been relevant in
all the current situation, through the analysis of vaccination and daily cases it was possible to
validate this hypothesis because although the cases have decreased, it has not been only due
to the vaccination plan.

The vaccination analysis has shown that herd immunity will be achieved in less than
3 months in all Australian states, however it is necessary to emphasize that there are many
people against the vaccination plan, it would be necessary to make an evaluation on how this
could impact with regarding the number of daily cases.

For further research, it will be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the second dose
after 6 months and evaluate the number of daily cases, this will give us more information on
whether Australiaâ€™s plans to open international borders are consistent with the effectiveness
of the vaccine.
